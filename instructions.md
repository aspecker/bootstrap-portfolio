Responsiveness Assignment
Overview
In this assignment, you will be building your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

Before You Begin
You've learned a ton of material: HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap. If you feel like you're falling behind, there's no need to panic. You'll have weeks to digest and master this material.

We're diving into JavaScript next week, and HTML/CSS will start receiving less focus. Still, you'll find that a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS will help you understand JavaScript, especially when we use it to manipulate web pages.

Instructions
Create a new GitHub repository and name it Bootstrap-Portfolio.

Clone this repository to your computer.

Instructions
Inside your Bootstrap-Portfolio repo, create index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html.

Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

A navbar

A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

eg. On xs and sm screens, each section should take up the entire grid. On m and larger screens, each section should take up 2/3 of the grid and the sidebar should take up 1/3 of the grid
Responsive images

BONUS Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-solumns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)

Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

Submitting Your Work on BootCampSpot
Submit the GitHub link to your portfolio repository on GitHub.

Submit the link to your (GitHub Pages) deployed site.

BONUS
Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio. More info here.
